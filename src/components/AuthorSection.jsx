            Hi there! <br /> My name is Sean PÃ©sek and I'm the author of Lily's
            and Shpoo's Adventures. I've always loved writing and creating
            stories, and this book is a product of that passion. I hope you and
            your little ones enjoy reading about Lila and Shpoo's adventures as
            much as I enjoyed writing about them.
